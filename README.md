# NLITrans at SemEval 18 Task 12

This repository holds a frozen version of the code used for our submission in SemEval 2018 Task 12: Argument Reasoning Comprehension Test, as described in our paper (TODO: link here).

## Preparing for Usage

1. Required repdendencies are defined in `environment.yml`.
2. Set the `ARCT_DIR` and `GLOVE_DIR` variables in `glovar.py` to point to the folder with the ARCT data and GloVe embeddings file. See the file for an example. 
3. Once the environment is ready you will need to run `prepare.py`

## Reproducing Our Results
